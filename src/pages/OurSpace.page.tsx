        At Little Lantern, we have created more than just a preschoolâ€”we've
        built a home away from home where children feel safe, inspired, and
        excited to learn. Designed by a team of international and Indian
        architects, our vibrant and thoughtfully planned environment encourages
        discovery at every turn. Our 20+ dynamic learning zones, spacious indoor
        and outdoor play areas, and interactive classrooms are designed to spark
        imagination and hands-on exploration.
